 * Memory in stage-1 is either valid (present) or invalid (absent).
 *
 * Memory in stage-2 has more states to track sharing, borrowing and giving of
 * memory. The states are made up of three parts:
 *
 *  1. V = valid/invalid    : Whether the memory is part of the VM's address
 *                            space. A fault will be generated if accessed when
 *                            invalid.
 *  2. O = owned/unowned    : Whether the memory is owned by the VM.
 *  3. X = exclusive/shared : Whether access is exclusive to the VM or shared
 *                            with at most one other.
 *
 * These parts compose to form the following state:
 *
 *  -  V  O  X : Owner of memory with exclusive access.
 *  -  V  O !X : Owner of memory with access shared with at most one other VM.
 *  -  V !O  X : Borrower of memory with exclusive access.
 *  -  V !O !X : Borrower of memory where access is shared with the owner.
 *  - !V  O  X : Owner of memory lent to a VM that has exclusive access.
 *
 *  - !V  O !X : Unused. Owner of shared memory always has access.
 *
 *  - !V !O  X : Invalid memory. Memory is unrelated to the VM.
 *  - !V !O !X : Invalid memory. Memory is unrelated to the VM.
 *
 *  Modes are selected so that owner of exclusive memory is the default.
